How to run the exercises depending on platform / language:

### Node.js (Any language)

Get [node.js and npm](http://nodejs.org) and do npm install on the root of the
repo.

### Javascript on node.js

To run the exercises `cd 134/node` (or other folder) and then run it with:

    node 134 1 2

### Livescript on node.js

Install livescript with npm.

  npm install -g LiveScript

(Remember to do an npm install on the root of the repo)

Get into the folder of the exercise `cd 133/node-ls` for example.

Compile the files (only use -w to keep the compiler watching the files)

    lsc -w -c *.ls
